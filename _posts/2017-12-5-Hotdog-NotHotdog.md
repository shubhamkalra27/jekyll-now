## Inspired from Silicon Valley tv show's Entrepreneur in Residence Jiyan Yang's app 

Here is an image classifier - which reads an uploaded image to classify as a hotdog or a not hotdog 


### Demo - http://nothotdog.pythonanywhere.com/ 

 

## Working


* Thanks to google's codelab demos of tensorflow for image classification [link](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/). 


* I fetched images for two categories
  -  hotdog
  -  non hotdogs included various other images like - sandwiches, pizzas, salads, pasta, movie covers, wallpapers etc to cover wide variety of images.


* Tensorflow is used to retrain MobileNet with a concept called Transfer learning. 
  * MobileNets are optimized to be small and efficient, at the cost of some accuracy, when compared to other pre-trained models
  * Transfer Learning, means starting with a model that has been already trained on another problem. Deep learning from scratch can take days, but transfer learning can be done in short order.

* Once model is ready, google has tricks to reduce the size of the model
  * tf includes a tool called optimize_for_inference, that removes all nodes that aren't needed for a given set of input and outputs.
  * The script also does a few other optimizations that help speed up the model, such as merging explicit batch normalization operations into the convolutional weights to reduce the number of calculations.
  * The second script called quantize_graph is available for optimization which quantizes the weight of the network allowing 


* List of all [Pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/998104bfdf14f74a2398e951325e4660862c5f20/slim#pre-trained-models) one can use to build an image classifier depending on usage and compute available


*  Demo hosted on ~~[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com)~~  [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) using Flask
   * Images extracted from google images using Fatkun Batch Download Image


## Potential
* Product #1: With enough training size and compute strength - Anyone can extend this to create the See-food App/ Shazam for food
* Product #3: App can indicate food with possible allergens
